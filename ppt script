DC – Introduction & Problem Statement

“Good [morning/afternoon] everyone. I am Devaanshi, and along with my teammate Sunidhi, we are excited to present our project – an AI-powered recruitment agent.

Let me start with a quick background.
HR today is no longer just about payroll and compliance. It is a strategic function at the heart of organizational success. With businesses relying more on technology, HR professionals who can use AI and data-driven insights are the ones driving real change and innovation.

And this is where Generative AI comes in. It’s not just a trend anymore – it’s reshaping the future of work. AI-driven strategies are taking HR careers to the next level by making them future-ready, more efficient, and smarter in decision-making.

But there’s also a challenge. Building such an AI-driven app in-house requires resources – money, time, and technical expertise. However, the benefits usually outweigh the costs because companies get complete customization, stronger data security, and tools that directly address their unique HR needs.

Now, moving to our problem statement – traditional recruitment is still very manual. HR teams often spend a lot of time screening hundreds of resumes. This process is slow, inconsistent, and costly. And because of that, many times the best candidates slip through. Clearly, there’s a gap, and that’s the problem we aimed to solve.”

SB – Solution & Benefits

“Thank you, Devaanshi.
To address this problem, we built an AI-powered recruitment agent that simplifies the entire hiring process.

Here’s how it works:

It automatically screens resumes by matching job descriptions with candidate profiles.

It provides ranked candidate recommendations, so HRs can focus on the best-fit talent first.

The system is user-friendly and ensures data security by following HR policies.

Now, let’s talk about the benefits:

It saves valuable time by automating resume screening.

It helps HRs find the right candidates faster and more efficiently.

It reduces manual effort and supports fair, data-driven decisions.

Overall, our solution empowers HR teams to work smarter, not harder, while ensuring a better candidate experience.”

DC – Challenges & Learnings

“Every project has its share of challenges, and this one was no exception.

One of our biggest challenges was handling JWT tokens for authentication. Initially, this blocked our AI analysis, but we resolved it by fixing token storage, secure passing, and resume ID tracking.

As a team, we also adopted agile-scrum methodology. This helped us collaborate better, divide tasks based on strengths, and track progress regularly.

Another key learning was that this was our first long-term team project. We learned how to balance different skill sets and communicate effectively.

And lastly, we explored and leveraged OpenAI extensively – not just for implementation but also for continuous updates and improvements. This deepened our technical knowledge as well as our problem-solving skills.”

SB – Future Scope

“Looking ahead, our project has strong potential to scale. Some of the future enhancements we envision are:

Integrating external resume databases or LinkedIn for a wider talent pool.

Adding candidate approval status for smoother HR workflows.

Introducing video interview analysis to evaluate soft skills.

Supporting multiple languages to increase inclusivity.

Enabling real-time collaboration among HR teams.

Making the AI continuously learn from feedback for more accurate recommendations.

And finally, integrating with popular HR management systems and job portals for end-to-end recruitment.”
