Intro
“Welcome to the Recruitment Agent — a smart hiring platform designed for both candidates and HR administrators. Let’s quickly walk through how it works.”

Candidate Portal

Signup/Login
“First, let’s step into the candidate’s journey. Candidates can sign up by creating their account with basic details and then log in seamlessly.”

Dashboard Overview
“Once logged in, the candidate lands on their dashboard, which clearly shows their role and gives easy navigation options.”

Exploring Job Descriptions
“Here, under ‘Job Descriptions’, candidates can browse all available roles. They can search by title or location, view details like experience required, skills, and education, and even download the JD as a PDF.”

Applying to Jobs
“Candidates can directly apply by uploading their resume against the job they’re interested in. The system ensures that their application is stored and linked to the correct job.”

HR Admin Portal

Dashboard Overview
“Now let’s look at the HR Admin’s side. On login, the dashboard displays quick statistics — total job descriptions created, resumes uploaded, registered candidates, and overall applications.”

Create & Manage Job Descriptions
“HRs can easily create new job postings with all required details, and manage existing ones with edit and delete options — a complete CRUD experience.”

Resume Upload & AI Analysis
“In the resume upload section, HRs can upload resumes directly against job descriptions. What’s powerful here is the built-in AI scoring — the system analyzes resumes, assigns relevance scores, highlights skills and experience, and even allows HRs to export a detailed report as a PDF.”

Viewing Resumes
“All uploaded resumes are stored and easily accessible under the ‘View Resumes’ section. HRs can search, filter, and open resumes in just one click.”

Best Fit Candidate Recommendations
“And finally, one of the most impactful features — the ‘Best Fit Candidate’ recommendations. Based on a selected job description, the system recommends the top candidates that align most closely with the role, saving time and effort in shortlisting.”

Closing
“In summary, Recruitment Agent creates a smooth experience for candidates to apply and a powerful toolkit for HRs to manage jobs, analyze resumes with AI, and select the best talent. It’s a seamless bridge between candidates and recruiters, making hiring smarter and faster.”
